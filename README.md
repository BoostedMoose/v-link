# Welcome to the Boosted Moose V-Link project!

![TITLE IMAGE](resources/media/banner.jpg?raw=true "Banner")

### Let's face it. MMIs from the 2000s suck.

This project was started because no suitable aftermarket solution could be found. I wanted to implement live vehicle data as well as AndroidAuto/Apple CarPlay in an **OEM like fashion** to enhance the driving experience of retro cars and give the user the ability to tinker around.

The heart of this project is the open source **V-Link app**. It's running natively on Raspberry Pi OS which enables full support of an OS without the restrictions of 3rd party images. **The custom V-Link HAT** builds the bridge between the Raspberry Pi and the car and works plug and play with the app. To use this application you need a Raspberry Pi, the V-Link Hat (optional) and an HDMI-screen, preferably with touch support.


 *This project is in ongoing development. Feel free to fork it, create a new branch and open a pull request with your cool ideas. Do you have  any tips for improvement, need help or just want to be part of our awesome little community?*
